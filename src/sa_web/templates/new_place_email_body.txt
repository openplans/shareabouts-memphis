Through the Our Miami initiative, The Miami Foundation fosters community by
building attachment to the city, developing public spaces and retaining
young talent in Miami. Our Miami uses research from their Soul of the
Community Study that clearly shows activating public spaces and attracting
young, talented and creative people in Greater Miami will grow the economy
faster than other more traditional measures of economic development.
