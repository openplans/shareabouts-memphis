<p>Do you want to create a space for neighbors to meet and spend quality time together? Would better access to healthy foods make your neighborhood richer? Do your neighbors want the streets to be safer for kids, pedestrians and cyclists? Would a mural build community and create neighborhood pride? Do you have an idea to encourage more businesses in your neighborhood? More trees? Or more friendliness?</p>

<p>We're asking for people with big ideas to begin with small steps to get things started. This tool is designed to build on that energy and enthusiasm and bring your ideas to life, together with our neighbors.</p>

<p>So, Memphis, share your ideas! Explore ideas already submitted by your neighbors. Click "support" to show some love to your favorites and "commit to help" to pitch in to the ones you love the most.</p>

<p>We all have a secret big idea, an unshakable feeling that we can make a difference in our own communities, on our block. So, Let's share our dreams for change and bring them to life, together with our neighbors, and #CreateMemphis. Ready?</p>
