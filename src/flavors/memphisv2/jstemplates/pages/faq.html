<h1>{{#_}}FAQ{{/_}}</h1>

<h4>{{#_}}What kind of ideas can I suggest?{{/_}}</h4>
<p>{{#_}}Ideas can include anything that you believe would make your neighborhood stronger, from block beautification projects to leadership training, from after school programs to new business development. Dream big, but frame your ideas in small-scale actions at the block or neighborhood level.{{/_}}</p>

<h4>{{#_}}What happens after I post my idea?{{/_}}</h4>
<p>{{#_}}If you tell us you're committed to making your idea happen, we'll reach out to see what we can do to help you get funding, resources, volunteers and anything else you might need to bring your idea to life.{{/_}}</p>

<h4>{{#_}}Who is behind the Create Memphis campaign?{{/_}}</h4>
<p>{{#_}}ioby and Livable Memphis created this project together to amplify and support existing work here in Memphis. Since ioby's launch in Memphis, Memphians have given more than $100,000 to ioby campaigns Memphis neighborhoods led by people just like you.{{/_}}</p>

<p>{{#_}}ioby, which stands for "in our backyards," is designed for Memphians to lead, develop, fund and bring to life ideas for projects in their own neighborhoods. The foundational principle of ioby is that leaders should begin community change by working on their own blocks first.{{/_}}</p>

<h4>{{#_}}What are the "seeking funding" projects?{{/_}}</h4>

<p>{{#_}}These are ideas that fellow Memphians are fundraising for on the ioby.org platform. See one you love? Click through to the ioby campaign page and make a donation to help make it real! See one that you are interested in being a part of? Just click the "Commit to help" button and we'll put you in touch.{{/_}}</p>

<h4>{{#_}}What are the "underway" projects?{{/_}}</h4>

<p>{{#_}}These are ideas that fellow Memphians have already begun turning into reality after successfully raising the funding they needed using the ioby.org platform. Want to get involved? Just click the "Commit to help" button and we'll connect you.{{/_}}</p>

<h4>{{#_}}What does it mean to "Commit" to a project?{{/_}}</h4>

<p>{{#_}}That means you are willing to step forward and give of your time, talent or treasure to help turn an idea that you believe in into real change for Memphis. Ideas need all different kinds of support to become reality, so if you'd like to be involved — even if you're not sure how yet — let us know! We'll connect you with the person(s) behind the idea and with the other Memphians who've also committed to help. It's an easy first step to getting involved, but you're not on the hook for anything specific. Think of it like raising your hand when you're moved to join in when someone asks, "Who's with me?"{{/_}}</p>

<h4>{{#_}}What does the "Support" button mean?{{/_}}</h4>

<p>{{#_}}This is a way to anonymously show your love for great ideas. Feel free to spread the love around to as many ideas as you like! See one or more you can really get behind? Why not also click the "Commit to help" button and be a part of making it happen? (see above){{/_}}</p>

<h4>{{#_}}What happens if I share my contact information?{{/_}}</h4>

<p>{{#_}}We have the utmost respect for your privacy.

Want to share useful information with the person(s) behind an idea? Leave a comment sharing your thoughts and we'll connect you. See an idea you want to be a part of?
