<h4>Who is behind the Create Memphis campaign?</h4>
<p>ioby and Livable Memphis created this project together to amplify and support existing work here in Memphis. Since ioby's launch in Memphis, Memphians have given more than $100,000 to ioby campaigns Memphis neighborhoods led by people just like you. </p>

<p>ioby, which stands for "in our backyards," is designed for Memphians to lead, develop, fund and bring to life ideas for projects in their own neighborhoods. The foundational principle of ioby is that leaders should begin community change by working on their own blocks first. </p>
