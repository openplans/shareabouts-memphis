<p>This isn’t the first time Memphians have contributed great ideas to make Memphis even stronger. This tool is designed to build on that energy and enthusiasm and bring your ideas to life.</p>

<p>Do you want to create a space for neighbors to meet and spend quality time together? Would better access to healthy foods make your neighborhood richer? Do your neighbors want the streets to be safer for kids, pedestrians and cyclists? Would a mural build community and create neighborhood pride? Do you have an idea to encourage more businesses in your neighborhood? More trees? Or more friendliness?</p>
 
<p>We’re asking for people with big ideas to start with small steps to get things started, and make incremental change.</p>
 
<p>But we don’t just want ideas. We want citizens to commit to leading projects to make those ideas reality.</p>  
 
<p>Start by focusing on your own neighborhood, your community, your block. Begin by working with your neighbors.</p>  
 
<p>We all have a secret big idea, an unshakable feeling that we can make a difference in our own communities, on our block.  So, let’s share our secret dreams for change and bring them to life, together with our neighbors.</p>
